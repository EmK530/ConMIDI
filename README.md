# ConMIDI-rawstore

This branch modifies the code to load the MIDI tracks directly into memory and parse events during playback

This speeds up loading, lowers memory usage by double but slows down the playback performance.

Thanks to recent optimizations, the playback performance loss is almost unnoticeable!

## Contributions

This branch is pretty final as I've applied all speed tricks I can.

If you can come up with any improvements though, feel free to help out!
